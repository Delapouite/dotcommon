dotcommon is a crawler that is built to answer questions
*What are the most popular Bash aliases?*,
*What are the most popular Vundle plugins for Vim?*, etc.
It crawls GitHub repos that match topic ``dotfiles`` and counts such things.

=========
Some data
=========

All of the below was generated by crawling first 500 results of
GitHub search ``topic:dotfiles``.

10 most common Vim set statements (``vimrc`` was found in 165 repos):

+-----------------+-----+
| set incsearch   | 114 |
| set hlsearch    | 110 |
| set ignorecase  | 108 |
| set expandtab   | 104 |
| set nocompatible| 103 |
| set laststatus=2| 103 |
| set autoindent  | 103 |
| set number      | 101 |
| set smartcase   | 95  |
| set showcmd     | 83  |
+-----------------+-----+

===============
Try it yourself
===============

Clone the repository. The only external dependency is PyGithub.

``dotcommon.py`` is an executable that imports dotcommon modules
and brings you into Python REPL. First of all, you need to generate
an access token for GitHub and create an instance of ``Github`` class:

.. code-block:: python
    g = Github("your_token_here")

The primary operation is *counting atoms* where an *atom* is alias,
readline macro, import statement, etc.

You may use any of the existing presets to generate an instance
of ``collections.Counter`` which will contain counted atoms.

.. code-block:: python
    counter = count_atoms(g, *presets.vim_set_statements)
